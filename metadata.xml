    <description>I tried to recreate the game [b]DEVIL DAGGERS[/b] in [b]TBOI[/b].

You will find in this mod :
[list]
[*]A new challenge &quot;Devil Daggers&quot; that imitates the game.
[*]A new nameless(?) playable character and his tainted version.
[*]2 items
[*]New enemies.
[/list]

Collecting gems will give you more firepower if you have one of the Devil Daggers items.
For a good balance, gems needed for upgrades are divided by 2 when playing with the new character.

This mod is not perfect but I tried my best to tribute this game I love (even if I suck at it).

For the game stability, in the challenge at 259 seconds, only 1 Gigapede will appear as 150 Larry parts at the same time break the game.

Items are compatible with the External Item Description mod.

I would like to thank the Modding Of Isaac community that helped me fix some problems and the Devil Daggers wiki for the infos.

Feel free to give me feedback or try to improve my mod.

Enjoy.

Every sounds used belong to [b]SORATH[/b].
Every sprite desgins were inspired by those created by [b]SORATH[/b].</description>
